# Deconvolution - Making the Most of Fluorescence Microscopy

*Date:  April 2014*

* Task: follow a complete deconvolution workflow. Hurdles: algorithm selection, PSF-innaccuracy compensation, noise-model calibration and regularization-parameter adjustment. 
* Goal: Generate the best-possible estimate of the ground-truth data by inverting the convolution operation without amplifying noise in an overwhelming manner.

* Metrics: Collection of quantitative performance metrics (MSE, SSIM, NMISE, etc) and more advanced structure-oriented and post-processing-based metrics. 

* What does PSF stand for? Point Spread Function describes the response of an imaging system to a point source or point object. General term: system's impulse response.
